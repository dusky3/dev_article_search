## How to Use
Set up a local config.py file and add your Dev.to API key, google API key and serahc engine ID, following this format:

```
GOOGLE_API_KEY = "< Enter key here >"

SEARCH_ENGINE_ID = "< Enter ID here >"

DEV_API_KEY = "< Enter key here >"
```

To run the script, enter the following into the command line:
`python search.py`

Next, manually open any links that look like they may include stolen content.
